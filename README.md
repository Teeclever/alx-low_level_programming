## Overview

This repository is designed as a comprehensive resource for individuals interested in learning or revisiting C programming concepts. It covers fundamental and advanced topics to provide a solid understanding of the C language.
## WHAT IS C
> C programming is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is one of the most widely used programming languages due to its efficiency, flexibility, and portability. C is known for its structured approach, allowing low-level access to memory and hardware, making it suitable for system and application software development.
